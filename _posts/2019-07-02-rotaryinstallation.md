The 49th installation of Rotary Bangalore East was held on 02/07/2019 where the then prospective rotaractors of RBE gathered to celebrate the conceptualisation of the club! 

It was a great opportunity for rotaractors to meet and interact with Rotarians of the parent Rotary as well as other Rotarians.
