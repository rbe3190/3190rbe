**Plant and Greet: Meet your community with a message!**

We, Easterners, decided to meet the citizens of our locality and community and promote a greener living space! 

> Be known, but for a Good Cause <br>(Our Mantra)

Knocking our way through the neighbourhood, we connected with our community while promoting greener living. 

Our Rotaractors distributed 50 plant pots amongst the residents of Domlur along with Rotaract Bangalore East stickers and bookmarks.


The event was overseen by able Chair, Rtr. Ragesh.
