Rotaract Bangalore East collaborated with more than 25 clubs across the nation to participate to showcase the support for Cancer Patients on the occasion of World Rose Day.

The Rotaractors participating in this project had visited the Cancer care centre and spent time with Patients.

Between 09 September 2019 and 30 September 2019, over 50 Rotaractors from across different Districts in South Asia participated in the initiative.

We thanks all the partner clubs for joining hands with us!

The initiative was Chaired by Rtr. Nikhila & Rtr. Ragesh.
