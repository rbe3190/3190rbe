On the occasion of Kannada Rojyotsava, members of Rotaract Bangalore East visited ASHA NIKETAN - a home for individuals with special needs. We were joined by the Rotarians of our Parent Rotary.

A small session of singing, dancing, passing the ball was conducted to bring a smile across the faces of the specially-abled residents!
