Rotaract Bangalore East distributed sanitary pads to the girls at [Belaku Shishu Nivasa](https://belaku.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Amrutha Sisu Nivasa](http://www.asn.org.in/){:target="_blank"} and [Abalashrama](https://www.abalashram.org/){:target="_blank"} to support the girls struggling to maintain their basic needs during the current situation of the pandemic.

We donated 178 sanitary pads to over 100 girls amounting to Rs. 2,487/- for the cause.

We thanks Rtr. Dhathri for leading the initiative. We also thank Rotaract Club of Ambarnath, RID 3142, Mumbai for uniting clubs across various Districts for the cause.
