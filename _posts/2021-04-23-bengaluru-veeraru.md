On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, Rotaract Bangalore East joined hands with Let's Be The Change to organise a Cleanathon and wall painting event.


The spirit of the event was to create awareness about littering and promoting a clean city by taking a small step ourselves!

The project was chaired by Rtr. Abhishek.
