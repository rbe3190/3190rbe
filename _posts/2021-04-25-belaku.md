  Celebrating Diwali with dumb and deaf kids.
---
BELAKU was a heartwarming project hosted by the Rotaract Club of K.G.F. Community in association with Rotaract Banglore East and Rotaract Club of Gems B School.

13 Rotaractors from Bangalore joined hands with us in celebrating Deepavali with children.

We started the celebration at **SVR Global Standard School** in Bangarpet by conducting fun games for children and was followed by special singing and dance performances from both kids and Rotaracters. The team then distributed chocolates to participants. 


Post lunch Rotaractors visited **Shatashrunga Educational Institute for dumb and deaf children** and learnt the basics of sign language from the staff. 

Then Rotaractors celebrated Deepavali by distributing sweets to the kids and bursting crackers with them. The basic ration was also donated to them. 

The Rotaractors proceed to SVR global standard school for dinner and night stay.

The following day all the Rotaractors departed back to Banglore. Rotaractors had a great experience spending time with the kids and created memories that stay for years to come.
