**World Immunization Week** is celebrated every year in the **last week of April** to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease.

World Immunization Week 2021 is themed "**Vaccines bring us closer**". Vaccines have been around for over 200 years, bringing humanity closer by saving us from dangerous diseases.

In these trying times of the current pandemic, let’s UNITE to raise the awareness to:

* Increase trust and confidence in vaccines to maintain or increase vaccine acceptance
* Increase investment in vaccines, including routine immunization, to remove barriers to access

On the occasion of World Immunization Week, we are sharing 3 quick facts on Rotary’s fight against Polio:

* Rotary and its partners have reduced polio cases by 99.9% worldwide since 1979.
* Nearly 3 billion children in 122 countries children have been saved from becoming paralyzed by polio.
* Only 2 countries continue to report wild polio cases.

Talking about #EndPolio we would like to recall some images in our gallery from the recent National Immunization Day in January of 2021.
